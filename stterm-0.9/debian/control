Description: simple terminal emulator for X
 st is a terminal emulator from the suckless project with a focus on
 simplicity, clarity and frugality. The project's philosophy is about
 keeping things simple, minimal and usable.
 .
 st supports most VT10X escape sequences, serial lines, XIM, utmp via
 utmp(1), clipboard handling, mouse and keyboard shortcuts, UTF-8, wide
 characters, resize, 256 colors, true colors, antialiased fonts (using
 fontconfig), fallback fonts, and line drawing. It does *not* provide
 a scrollback buffer: users are encouraged to use a terminal multiplexter.
 .
 This Debian package is called 'stterm' for historical reasons.
